# Image-Classification
This work is part of the COMP3420: AI for Text and Vision assignment at Macquarie University. The dataset for this project is sourced from the [Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). It contains image data of Natural Scenes around the world.

This data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. The Train, Test and Prediction data are divided into separate files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
This data was initially published on [https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com) by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.

### Tasks Overview
- Task 1: Data exploration and prepare data for later model application.

- Task 2: Implement simple image classifiers and conduct an evaluation. 

- Task 3: Implement Convolutional Network (ConvNet) and Pre-trained models (MobileNet) and conduct a more elaborate evaluation using confusion matrices from Keras datasets.
